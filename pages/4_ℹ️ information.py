st.write('**Scope**')
st.write('The scope of the software is to calculate thermal heat loss and consequently the fluid temperature drop in a piping system troughout several layers of insulation.')
st.write('')
st.write('**Program Flow**')

st.write('**Main**: select new or stored project and press ***start*** ... ‚û°Ô∏è **General Data**: input data and tick the checkbox to confirm ... ‚û°Ô∏è **Temperature Drop**: describe the piping circuit, tick the checkbox ***Ready to run*** and then click on ***Run*** button to perform the analysis. At the end of analysis, the button ***Dowload PDF Report*** will appear in the sidebar üèÅ')

st.write('**Analysis method**')
st.write('The analysis method is iterative. For each section of pipe, the program calculates the amount of heat exchanged by radiation, convection and conduction and performs a balancing to find the equilibrium state step by step. ')
st.write('Once equilibrium is reached, the temperature values ‚Äã‚Äãof the fluid and the temperature reached by the surface of the various insulation layers are obtained. ')
st.write('The results will be reported in a table and displayed in a graph showing the temperature drop along the path of the pipe. ')
